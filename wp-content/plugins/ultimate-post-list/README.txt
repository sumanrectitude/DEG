Make up custom-tailored preview lists of the contents easily and place them in widget areas and post contents.

== Description ==

Make up custom-tailored preview lists of your website's contents easily and place them in widget areas and post contents.

Promote your website’s content with many kinds of post lists. No programming skills are necessary. No fiddling with templates. With just a few keyboard entries and clicks you get a customized posts list.

The plugin Ultimate Post List for WordPress gives you an easy-to-use toolbox to make lists of posts. You can insert the lists

* as **widgets in every widget area** per drag'n'drop easily
* via **configurable shortcodes in every post content**
* via **calls of the function upl_print_list()** in PHP code

You can switch between a **vertical list layout** or a **responsive grid layout**. A few options help you to get a nice layout without any need to code.

You can **filter** the posts by their **post type** "Post" or/and "Page" and by multiple **categories**.

You can switch on a **"Load more posts"** link or button which loads further posts without leaving the page. Its text is controlled easily for you.

The plugin is **multi-widget capable**. That is, you can have several widgets of Ultimate Post List on your blog, each with its own settings!

You can clone (duplicate, copy) every list with a single click on the action link.

The plugin is available in English, German (Deutsch) and Greek (Ελληνικά). It does not collect any personal data, so it is ready for EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) compliance.
